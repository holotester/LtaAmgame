1) There should be 4 .tmx files downloaded (normal/zebra/traffic/bridge)

2) A tileManager.cs should be downloaded too

How to implement:
1 - Can uncheck the other existing maps to avoid confusion
2 - Create empty gameObject name "TileManager"
3 - Attach the tileManager.cs script to it
4 - Drag/Add the 4 different .tmx files to the list after importing it to TiledMapEditor (No specific order)

If not working:
Try change Y position of TileManager to -150 (BUT everything needs to be shifted)

Things you can try:
1 - Remove the ability for the player to move backwards
2 - There are colliders between grass & cycling path (Should work) exclude bridge.tmx
